The island bathes in the sun's bright rays
Distant hills wear a shroud of grey
A lonely breeze whispers in the trees
Sole witness to history
Fleeting memories rise
From the shadows of my mind
Sing "nonomori" - endless corridors
Say "nonomori" - hopeless warriors
You were there
You were there
Am I forever dreaming
How to define the way I'm feeling
You were there
Countless visions they haunt me in my sleep
You were there
Though forgotten all promises we keep
Slaves to our destiny
I recall a melody
Sing "nonomori" - seasons lit with gold
Say "nonomori" - legends yet untold
You were there
You were there
Happiness follows sorrow
Only believing in tomorrow
You were there
Countless visions they haunt me in my sleep
You were there
Though forgotten all promises we keep
The island bathes in the sun's bright rays
Distant hills wear a shroud of grey
A lonely breeze whispers in the trees
Sole key to this mystery

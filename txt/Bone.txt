Recreating that feeling again
Forever harder at getting you in
Take a hit if you miss the mark
Always loving that step in the dark
To each his own never think twice about it
She's on your phone
Saying there's no without it
It's getting old but I want you to know
That it cuts straight through the bone
You think it's easy for me
Collapsing under my dreams
Could shake it off but you don't
And it cuts straight through the bone
Am I supposed to believe
You'd ever give it up for me?
It's worse each time I let go
And it cuts straight through the bone
So this is how it's gonna be
It's necessary to get what you need
I'm at the limit it's shady to see
Of course you're not concerned about me
To each his own never think twice about it
She's on your phone
Saying there's no without it
Soon you'll be cold but I want you to know
That it cuts straight through the bone
You think it's easy for me
Collapsing under my dreams
Could shake it off but you don't
And it cuts straight through the bone
Am I supposed to believe
You'd ever give it up for me?
It's worse each time I let go
And it cuts straight through the bone
Such a crush to see your face
It's all too much just to hear your name
Soon enough when you rush to find
The open arms you left behind
You think it's easy for me
Collapsing under my dreams
Could shake it off but you don't
And it cuts straight through the bone
Am I supposed to believe
You'd ever give it up for me?
It's worse each time I let go
And it cuts straight through the bone
It's such a shame, the mess we made
It's such a shame, the mess we made
It's such a shame and it cuts straight through the bone

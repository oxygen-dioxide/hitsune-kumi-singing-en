Well I been on the council twenty year
An’ I’ll never leave it don’t you fear
One time they tried to get rid a me
But I wouldn’t take me redundancy
Oh keep the shovel tippin’
You won’t feel the time a slippin’
Come in time, go home in time
And take your time all day

Oh keep your shovel tippin’
You won’t feel the time is slippin’
Come in time, go home in time 
And take your time all day

Well I started off as a shovel man
Then they made me a ganger man
I think the time is coming near 
When I become an overseer

Oh keep your shovel tippin’
You won’t feel the time is slippin’ 
Come in time, go home in time
And take your time all day

Oh keep your shovel tippin’
You won’t feel the time is slippin’
Come in time, go home in time 
And take your time all day

Well the overseer, he’s not so bad
He’s retiring soon and I’m so glad
Because I think I’ll get his job
And it's worth an extra few ol' bob

Oh keep your shovel tippin’ 
You won’t feel the time is slippin’
Come in time, go home in time
And take your time all day

Oh keep the shovel tippin’ 
You won’t feel the time is slippin’
Come in time, go home in time 
And take your time all day

If it’s a cold old day, you've nothing to fear
‘Cause you’ll never see an engineer
He’s in the office, all locked up
Delving into a big hot cup

Oh keep the shovel tippin’
You won’t feel the time a slippin’
Come in time, go home in time
And take your time all day

Oh keep the shovel tippin’ 
You won’t feel the time a slippin’
Come in time, go home in time
And take your time all day

Oh keep your shovel tippin’ 
You won’t feel the time a slippin’ 
Come in time, go home in time
And take your time all day

Oh keep the shovel tippin’ 
You won’t feel the time is slippin’ 
Come in time, go home in time 
And take your time all day

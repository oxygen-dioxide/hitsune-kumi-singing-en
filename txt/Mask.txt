I wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time
Stare at the ceiling while I hold back what's on my mind
And when they ask me how I'm doing, I say, "I'm just fine"
But the fact is
I can never get off of my mattress
And all that they can ask is
"Why are you so sad, kid?"
That 's what the mask is
That's what the point of the mask is

So you can see I'm trying, you won't see me crying
I'll just keep on smiling, I'm good
And it just keeps on piling, it's so terrifying
But I keep on smiling, I'm good
I've been caring too much for so long
Been comparing myself for so long
Been wearing a smile for so long, it's real
So long, it's rеal, so long, it's real


Always being judged by a bunch of strangе faces
Scared to go outside, haven't seen the light in ages
But I've been places
So I'm okay-ish, so I'm okay-ish
But the fact is
I need help, I'm failing all my classes
They think that I need glasses
I just really wish that I could pass this


That's what the mask is
That's what the point of the mask is

So you can see I'm trying, you won't see me crying
I'll just keep on smiling, I'm good
And it just keeps on piling, it's so terrifying
But I keep on smiling, I'm good
I've been caring too much for so long
Been comparing myself for so long
Been wearing a smile for so long, it's real
So long, it's real, so long, it's real

So long, it's real
So long, it's real

You and I should head downtown
Just drivin' around
See all the faces
The beautiful faces
The beautiful faces
The beautiful faces
The beautiful faces
The beautiful faces
The beautiful faces
Midnight in L.A.
My highlights look better than okay.
I see the neon glow
Down down below
I'm in the city that doesn't sleep
I wanna stop but I'm in too deep
As city light shimmer by
I must be high
Beautiful faces
The beautiful faces
The beautiful faces
The burnt out faces
Beautiful faces
The beautiful faces
The beautiful faces
The burnt out faces
I'm in L.A.
My highlights look okay.

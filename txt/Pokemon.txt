I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokémon to understand
The power that's inside
Pokémon
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokémon
Ooh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokémon gotta catch 'em
Our heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all
Gotta catch 'em all
Pokémon

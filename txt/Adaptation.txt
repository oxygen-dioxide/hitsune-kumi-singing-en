What you love is what defines you
Even if it doesn't love you too
So put the pain behind you
She is gone but she's a part of you
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
You, you felt the tears come down
Cause you really lost her now
And this really broke you down
She's not around anymore
And they all say that you need to stop hanging on
But they don't know she's the reason that you carry on
Cause what you love is what defines you
Even if it doesn't love you too
So put the pain behind you
She is gone but she's a part of you
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
So you fell but she couldn't be tied down
But you still believe somehow
That something will turn around
It's not your fault, you stood your ground
They try to tell you she did you wrong and to just move on
But they don't know that she lives in you and keeps you strong
And what you love is what defines you
Even if it doesn't love you too
So put the pain behind you
She is gone but she's a part of you
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is
They don't know what love is

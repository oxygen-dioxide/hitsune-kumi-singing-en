When we were living in squalor, wasn't it heaven
Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
Eventually terrible memories turn into great ones
So if they call you, embrace them
If they hold you, erase them
Cause it might've been something, who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed something, don't say
Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been digging it up like Groundhog Day
Cause it might've been something, don't say
Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
Matty said life didn't go the way that he planned it
Said "oh what I'd give to start over, Boy I demand it"
So what was I ever afraid of? Why did I worry?
And why was I ever so brainless? Head in a flurry
Cause if they call you, embrace them
If they stall you, erase them
Cause it might've been something, who's to say?
Does it help to get lost in yesterday?
And you might've missed something, don't say
Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been digging it up like Groundhog Day
Cause it might've been something, don't say
Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
If it calls you, embrace it
If it haunts you, face it
I know it's mad, I understand
It's only snakes and ladders
The period, you never had
There's only one that matters
And if it calls you, embrace it
And if it haunts you, erase it
Replace it

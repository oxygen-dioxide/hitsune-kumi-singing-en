Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How was I to know
How was I to know this high came rushing
We're on the borderline
Dangerously fine and unforgiving
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday
Here I go
Quite a show for a loner in LA
I wonder how I managed to end up in this place
Where I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
little Closer, Close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Any Closer, Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
Rudy said it's fine
They used to do this all the time in college
if you and I get comfortable
on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little Closer, Close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Setting free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Any Closer, Close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun

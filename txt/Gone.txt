On two legs, but my feet never touch the ground
I got my head in the soil, leave no prints to be found
The nature's strength, the wonder who I am
A weakening force, all echoes from my past
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
And the battle goes on
And the love that you felt will be here when you are gone
And the songs that you sung
And the words that you meant will be here when you are gone
This mouth on me, and this voice against time
Be brave and free or be wing clipped and grimed
This weakening noise will fade softly to silence
And the battle goes on
And the love that you felt will be here when you are gone
And the songs that you sung
And the words that you meant will be here when you are gone
And the battle goes on
And the love that you felt will be here when you are gone
And the songs that you sung
And the hurt that you felt will be here when you are gone
One final moment as I stay awake
As the air I breathe will make a change of space
They'll never know, they'll never feel the ache
The drips of salt you're tasting off my face
The nature's strength, the wonder who I am
And the battle goes on
And the love that you felt will be here when you are gone
And the songs that you sung
And the words that you meant will be here when you are gone
And the battle goes on
And the love that you felt will be here when you are gone
And the songs that you sung
And the hurt that you felt will be here when you are gone

I had a dream that I could fly
I can feel each moment
As time goes by
We'd never be too far away
You would always be here
I heard you say
I never thought
Thought that it would be our last good bye
I still can dream
That one day love will fall out from the sky
Do you still remember
All the time that has gone by
Do you still believe that
Love can fall out from the sky
If from where you're standing
You can see the sky above
I'll be waiting for you
If you still believe in love
Find a way
To bring back yesterday
Find a way to love
I hope we stay
When tomorrow becomes today
Love will find a way
I'll be waiting for you
In my heart you are the one
If I cannot find you
I will look up to the sun
If from where you're standing
You can see the sky above
I'll be waiting for you
If you still believe in love
Do you believe?
Do you still remember
All the time that has gone by
Do you still believe that
Love can fall out from the sky
If from where you're standing
You can see the sky above
I'll be waiting for you
If you still believe in love
La la la la la la
la la la la la la la
La la la la la la
la la la la la la la
Do you believe?

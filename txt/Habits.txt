I eat my dinner in my bathtub
Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything, I'm restless
Yeah, I've been around, and I've seen it all
I get home, I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money
Days got kinda lonely
You're gone, and I gotta stay high all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Pick up daddies at the playground
How I spend my daytime
Loosen up their frown, make them feel alive
I'll make it fast and greasy
I'm on my way to easy
You're gone, and I gotta stay high all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end, ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain, oh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end, oh-oh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
You're gone, and I gotta stay high all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time to keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Spend my days locked in a haze
Trying to forget you, babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

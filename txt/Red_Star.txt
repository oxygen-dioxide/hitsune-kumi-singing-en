Best of cruel intentions
Binding what they fail to mention
No truth, all pretension
Raise your hand to give attention

You give it, we take it
You built it, we break it
You sign and we erase it
You feel it, we fake it

Steal it
Can't let go
Conceal it

Wasted education
Celebrating imitation
Misplaced admiration
Speaking for a generation

You give and, we take it
You build it, we break it
You sign and we erase it
You feel it, we fake it

It's my red star
It's my red star
It's my red star
It's my red star, oh no

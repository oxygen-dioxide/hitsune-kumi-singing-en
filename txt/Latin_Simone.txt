Give up if you wanna survive
Get oh so alive in your life
Everything falling out the sky on top of you
Now what you do?
Set yourself up now
It's the love of your life
Shallowly on me
All I know before it's gone
I always feel it's getting you down
If nothing's wrong
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
Give up if you wanna survive
Pick the sound back up
You got to get on the song, lonely
What's the point?
It's funny 'til you're left to kill yourself
In this town
So what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?

Tried to escape just yesterday
Though lately I can't pull myself away
We see ourselves above the fray
But still the sequence must be entertained
I'm holding out hope for another space-time
For now I am counting the days in the hours of my life
Oh the hours tongue tied
Ahh
Paraphernalia is on your mind
And paranoia turns you blind
Paraphernalia is everywhere
Can we escape from the delirium?
We hide in twilight, then we fall
We live the high life while the charge remains
A thousand visuals to be seen
A thousand reasons not to walk away
The light in the distance you're coming to see
Will join us in binary matrimony with ourselves
Oh, I hope you can tell
Ahh
Paraphernalia is on your mind
And paranoia turns you blind
Paraphernalia is everywhere
Can we escape from the delirium?
Paraphernalia is on our minds
Paraphernalia is in the sky tonight
Paraphernalia is in the air
Paraphernalia and paranoia
Paraphernalia is in the air
Paraphernalia and paranoia
Paraphernalia is on our minds
Paraphernalia is in the sky tonight
Paraphernalia is in the air
Paraphernalia and paranoia
Paraphernalia is on our minds
Paraphernalia is in the sky tonight

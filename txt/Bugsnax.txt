Kinda bug and kinda snack
Try to catch 'em in your trap
Feed somebody and you'll see
We are whatever we eat
Find 'em hiding in the sand
Tearing up a ketchup patch
Come to Snacktooth Island and
Discover it's Bugsnacks
I heard that somewhere far off in the ocean
There lies an island where the creatures roam
A famed explorer tells me they're delicious and yet
They're hitherto unknown
You might think it sounds impossible
'Til you've seen a carrot crawl
Kinda bug and kinda snack
Try to catch 'em in your trap
Feed somebody and you'll see
We are whatever we eat
Find 'em hiding in the sand
Tearing up a ketchup patch
Come to Snacktooth Island and
Discover it's Bugsnacks
It's Bugsnacks
Talkin' 'bout Bugsnacks
It's Bugsnacks
And if the rumour's not complete baloney
Then it's the story of the century
So grab a journal, listen up and make some new friends
To solve the mystery
You might think it sounds impossible
'Til you've seen a sandwich climb a wall
Kinda bug and kinda snack
Try to catch 'em in your trap
Feed somebody and you'll see
We are whatever we eat
Find 'em hiding in the sand
Tearing up a ketchup patch
Come to Snacktooth Island and
Discover it's Bugsnacks
It's Bugsnacks
Talkin' 'bout Bugsnacks
It's Bugsnacks
Everyone's talkin' 'bout Bugsnacks
It's Bugsnacks

Run your fingers down the cool
Underbelly of the blue evening
Crank that vapor-wagon
Start that kickin' dragon beating
Step out on the patio
Follow where your daddy-o's leading
Wrestle with our shadow twins
Hold'em 'til they're glowin' in warning
Hit that bubble kit now
Laughin' as you breathe out, easy
Drop another daffodil
We can push on through 'til morning
Drop another daffodil sail off the map until morning
Baby just say no to sleep
Bodies gotta keep exploring
Sweet volcano violence
Vast new continents spawning
Drop another daffodil
We can push on through 'til morning
Drop another daffodil sail right off the map until morning
Put another record on
Maybe Chaka Khan or Rocky
Catch on fire above the
Green empire of the kraken
Flow with the isosceles
To the beat of six knees knocking
Drop another daffodil we can push on through 'til morning
Drop another daffodil sail right off the map until morning

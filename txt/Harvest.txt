Stay with me awhile
Rise above the vile
Name my final rest
Poured into my chest
Into the orchard, I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress
Stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death
All I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr
Pledge yourself to me
Never leave me be
Sweat breaks on my brow
Given time ends now
Into the orchard, I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress
Stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death
All I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr
Spirit painted sin
Embers 'neath my skin
Veiled in pale embrace
Reached and touched my face
Into the orchard, I walk peering way past the gate
Wilted scenes for us who couldn't wait
Drained by the coldest caress
Stalking shadows ahead
Halo of death
All I see is departure
Mourner's lament, but it's me who's the martyr

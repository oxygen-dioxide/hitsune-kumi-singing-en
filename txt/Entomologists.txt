I hear, humming
Buzzing, buzzing
Today marks one long dream
Burrowed deep inside
Sallowing faces
Leaving me behind
They talk about me, see?
I can hear them
They call their friends
Entomologists
Knock on wood, but I'd rather stay alone
And isolate intuition from unknown
You've bent my world, now, I'll never figure out
What it means, when I see, infestations in my dreams
Today marks two long dreams
Festering away
Sallowing bodies
Crawling on all fours
They talk about me
They get in real close
They call themselves
Metamorphosis
Knock on wood, but I'd rather stay alone
And isolate intuition from unknown
You've bent my world, now, I'll never figure out
What it means, when I see, infestations in my dreams

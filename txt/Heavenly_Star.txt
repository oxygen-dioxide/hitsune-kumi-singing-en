I hear you whisper surrounded in silence
Blue vibration
I hear the waves singing in the distance
Pure isolation
I smile into the distance far away from you
We're in resolution
Dreaming, touching, breathing side by side
Dive into the sky
Let's get away, fly away
I found the path to paradise
Shining spiral of gold
Take my hand, find our way out
Heavenly stars above
Just believe what's in your heart
No border between us
I can always feel you inside
Wherever we are
I see you, feel you, I'm your creation
Ever lasting 'ffection
Life's an endless spiral going round
Yes, we are in love
Let's get away, fly away
I found the path to paradise
Shining spiral of gold
Take my hand, find our way out
Heavenly stars above
Just believe what's in your heart
No border between us
I can always feel you inside
Wherever we are
Let's get away, fly away
I'm feeling raindrops on my face
Sun shines through the clouds yeah
Rainbow all around us
I spread my wings, fly away
The wind sweeps me off my feet
Blowing me away yeah
Trees whispering to me
I'm feeling free yeah
I found the path to paradise
Shining spiral of gold
Take my hand, find our way out
Heavenly stars above
Just believe what's in your heart
No border between us 
I can always feel you inside
Wherever we are

It's always around me, all this noise, but
Not nearly as loud as the voice saying
"Let it happen, let it happen"
"Just let it happen, let it happen"
All this running around
Tryin' to cover my shadow
An ocean growing inside
All the others seem shallow
All this running around
Bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm
Must be morning
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound, and
When it happens, when it happens
So let it happen, let it happen
All this running around
I can't fight it much longer
Something's tryin' to get out
And it's never been closer
If my take-off fails
Make up some other story
But if I never come back
Tell my mother I'm sorry

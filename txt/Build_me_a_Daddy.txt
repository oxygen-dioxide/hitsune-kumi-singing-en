A boy walks past a window of a glowin' open sign
Full of wooden toys and trucks and painted trains
Rings a bell up on the counter, hands a picture to the man
Of a kid beside a soldier smiling away
Said, "Sir, I've heard you can build anything"
Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a Southern drawl
And a crooked smile, if you can
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back?
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make mama happy
If you could build me a daddy
There's an old Winchester rifle
Back home hangin' on the wall
He promised me he'd teach me how to aim
And he said when I got older
We could work on that curveball
I know he'd never wanna miss a game
So here's a little money that I've saved
Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a Southern drawl
And a crooked smile, if you can
I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back?
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make mama happy
If you could build me a daddy
Give him a big heart, make his arms wide open
I know he misses me, so Mister, I was hopin'
You could build me a daddy
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a Southern drawl
And a fishing pole in his hand
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back?
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make my mama happy
If you could you build me a daddy
Could you build me a daddy?
